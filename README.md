As there is some "little kids" say why I'm not open source, why they can not change images for they make their own product to share, the reason is currently I am busy on my work, and this project is helf-done which just finsihed basic funcations. 

I did research on the TFT data struct on my own, and now there is someone also shared the data struct that if the "kids" who complain of my project, pls just make it.

I will open source or make a perfect release on my free time once I finsihed my own work of this period, I am not the noob and I don't like the "kids" to get my half-done project then add some features say "I made it".

# Steps

1. Modify the config.json, change the PVE username and password
2. chmod +x core.bin
3. ./core.bin to start the program or put it into systemctl
# Config file

- "image_type" value could be "" (empty) or "shu". "shu" means vertical

# Versions

for PVE download the [PVE] version.

***for Linux/Windows/MacOS standalone download the [testing version 0.0.2](https://github.com/nov30th/s1-mini-computer-tft-screen-release/releases/tag/v0.0.2)***

Currently there is very very basic version in standalone version which is testing version, as I'm personal use my pve version and quite busy these days, the standalone updates may delay.

(if you need any features, just let me know I will put them into the program)
